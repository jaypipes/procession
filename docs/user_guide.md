# User Guide

## Identity and account management

There are a number of concepts involved in the authentication, authorization
and account management features of Procession. In this section, we describe
these concepts.

### User

A **user** is an identity that is used to log in to a Procession system and
perform an action.

### Organization

An **organization** is a collection of users.

## Authorization concepts

Whether or not a user is allowed to perform some action or access some resource
in Procession is determined by examining the set of **permissions** the user
has and the context within which the user has made a request.
